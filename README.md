## Description

This project extracts real-time post trends and stores them in a database. The project uses natural language processing techniques to analyze the posts and extract trends. The trends are stored in Supabase for later querying.

## Technologies Used

- **Deno**: Runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript.
- **Supabase**: Database to store the trends.
- **Compromise**: NLP library for text processing.
- **Google Gemini**: Generative AI API to classify topics.
<!-- - **Web Workers**: For parallel processing of posts. -->

## Features

- **N-grams Extraction**: Extraction of words, phrases, and hashtags from posts.
- **Content Filtering**: Filtering of stopwords, blacklist words, and irrelevant content.
- **Text Classification**: Topic classification using a text classifier.
- **Trend Storage**: Storage of trends in Supabase.
<!-- - **Parallel Processing**: Using a pool of workers for parallel processing of posts. -->

## Requirements

- **Deno**: Make sure you have Deno installed. You can install Deno by following the instructions [here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/).
- **Supabase**: Set up an account on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and obtain the necessary credentials.
- **Google Gemini API Key**: Set up an account on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) and create a project with the _Generative Language API_ enabled and obtain the API key.

The use of **Supabase** is optional and **Google Gemini** is used only to classify topics. You can replace these services with others of your choice.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Rafael-BD/Bsky-Trends
    cd Bsky-Trends
    ```

2. Set up the environment variables in the `.env` file:

    ```sh
    SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
    SVC_KEY=your_supabase_key
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the WebSocket client to listen to posts:

    ```sh
    deno run dev 
    ```

2. To get the current trends, uncomment line 3 in the `server.ts` file to start the HTTP server:
    ```ts
    // const app = new Application();

    // const router = new Router();

    // router.get("/trending", async (ctx) => {
    //     const trends = await getTrendingTopics(20, 'pt');
    //     ctx.response.body = trends;
    // });


    // // Middleware and routes
    // app.use(oakCors({ origin: "*" }));
    // app.use(router.routes());
    // app.use(router.allowedMethods());

    // console.log("App Operations Backend running on http://localhost:8003");

    // // Function to run the HTTP server
    // async function startHttpServer() {
    //     await app.listen({ port: 8003 });
    // }
    ```
    Now make GET requests to `http://localhost:8003/trending` to get the trends.

## Feature Explanation

### N-grams Extraction

The project extracts words, phrases, and hashtags from posts using NLP techniques. The extraction is done through the `extractWords`, `extractSentences`, and `extractHashtags` functions.

### Content Filtering

The extracted content is filtered to remove stopwords, blacklist words, and irrelevant content. The filtering is done through the `filterWords` and `filterSentences` functions.

### Text Classification

The extracted topics are classified using Google Gemini AI. The classification is done through the `classifyText` function.

### Trend Storage

The trends are stored in Supabase. The storage is done through the `saveTrend` function.

<!-- ### Parallel Processing

The project uses a pool of workers to process posts efficiently. The worker pool is implemented in the `workerPool.ts` file. -->
